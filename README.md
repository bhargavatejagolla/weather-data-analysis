# 🌦️ Weather Data Analysis

This is a **Data Analysis / Data Analytics project** where we perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a weather dataset using **Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.  
The goal is to clean, explore, and analyze weather conditions to uncover meaningful insights.

---

## 📌 Overview
- Load and explore the dataset (shape, columns, datatypes, indexes).  
- Clean the dataset and handle missing/irrelevant data.  
- Analyze unique weather conditions and their frequency.  
- Visualize data to identify trends and patterns.  

---
## 🚀 Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Install required libraries:
Make sure you have Python installed.
```bash
pip install pandas 
```
```bash
pip install numpy
```
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```
```bash
pip install seaborn
```
---
## ✨ Features
- Explore dataset structure (rows, columns, datatypes).  
- Find unique weather conditions and their counts.  
- Analyze frequent conditions like **Clear** and **Fog**.  
- Identify rare events such as **Snow** or **Thunderstorms**.  
- Beginner-friendly **Jupyter Notebook workflow** for EDA.
