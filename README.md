# 🌦️ Weather Data Analysis

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a weather dataset using **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**.  
The main objective is to clean, explore, and analyze weather conditions to identify patterns and insights that are useful for learning and real-world applications.

## 🧾 Project Type
**Data Analysis / Data Analytics Project**  
This project demonstrates how to work with real-world datasets, clean and preprocess data, and extract meaningful insights through EDA.  

---

## 📌 Overview
- Load and explore a weather dataset.  
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing (shape, columns, datatypes, missing values).  
- Analyze unique weather conditions and their frequency.  
- Study patterns and trends in weather observations.  
- Visualize data for better understanding.
